# Random Sentence Generator
Welcome to the Random Sentence Generator â€“ where creativity meets chaos! ðŸš€âœ¨

As a kid I used to love playing a game of random sentences. We would write down words on pieces of paper, scramble and pick randomly. 
We would cackle at the funny and weird ones.

## How to Play
### 1. Getting Started:

Run the program and press ENTER to create a randomly generated sentence.
Feel free to press any other key to quit the game and return to the real world.
### 2. Sentence Structure:

Each sentence is a delightful mishmash of subjects, verbs, adverbs, nouns, places, and more!
The generator employs a playful mix of parts of speech to create sentences that range from whimsical to downright absurd.
### 3. Unleash Creativity:

Witness the magic as the program crafts sentences on the fly, leaving you amused and pondering the wonders of linguistic randomness.
### 4. Endless Possibilities:

The sentence structure is dynamic, ensuring that no two sentences are alike. Embrace the uncertainty and enjoy the linguistic rollercoaster!
## How It Works
The generator reads from text files different types of words to construct a sentance that is uniquely unpredictable. 
The skeleton of each sentence is: **{other} {subject} and {other} {subject} {adverb} {verb} {noun} at {place}.**
The sentence has two subjects and both cannot be Julia Roberts (no repeating cause I have no clone machine)!
It also observes the need for capital letter in the beginning of a sentence.
In different color on a new line after the sentence there is an exclamation/comment "from the computer" like "Wohoa!".
## Text files info
The .txt files are included and consist of: verbs + prepositions - 80, subjects - 150, nouns both plural and singular - 90,
adverbs - 85, places - 90, other - 30 (2 * 15, capital/Non capital letter), 
25 exclamations. Other consists of words defining the subjects if they are plural like: some, the, nine, your, etc. The subjects and places
are both are imaginary and real (you can find Mordor in there as well as Ariana Grande).
