# Random Sentence Generator

As a kid I used to love playing a game of random sentences. We would write down words on pieces of paper, scramble and pick randomly. 
We would cackle at the funny and weird ones.

Upon start up there is a welcome screen. By pressing any key you continue forward.
Pressing **Enter** creates a new sentence. Pressing any other key will **quit** the program.
The generator reads from text files different types of words to construct a sentance. 
The skeleton of each sentence is: **{other} {subject} and {other} {subject} {adverb} {verb} {noun} at {place}.**
The sentence has two subjects and both cannot be Julia Roberts (no repeating cause I have to clone machine)!
It also observes the need for capital letter in the beginning of a sentence.
In different color on a new line after the sentence there is an exclamation like "Wohoa!".


The .txt files are included and consist of: verbs + prepositions - 80, subjects - 150, nouns both plural and singular - 90,
adverbs - 85, places - 90, other - 30 (2 * 15, capital/Non capital letter), 
25 exclamations. Other consists of words defining the subjects if they are plural like: some, the, nine, your, etc. The subjects and places
are both are imaginary and real (you can find Mordor in there as well as Ariana Grande).
